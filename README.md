Repositori ini berisi terkait Supervised Learning (classification), yang akan dibagi menjadi 3 bagian.

## Supervised 1: Classification (KNN, Decision Tree, dan Random Forest)

### Penjelasan Singkat Supervised 1
- KNN: is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm that classifies a new data point based on the k nearest neighbors of that data point. The class label of the new data point is then determined by the majority vote of the k nearest neighbors.
- Decision trees: are a supervised learning algorithm that classifies a new data point by recursively splitting the feature space into smaller and smaller regions until each region contains only data points of a single class.
- Random forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

## Supervised 2: Classification (SVM, Ensemble)
untuk dataset yang digunakan pada supervised bagian 2 yakni terkait HR_dataset:

### Penjelasan Singkat Supervised 2
- Super Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. SVMs work by finding a hyperplane that separates the data into two classes with the maximum margin.
- Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to produce a more accurate prediction. Ensemble learning works by exploiting the diversity of the predictions from the individual models. If the individual models make different mistakes, then the ensemble model is less likely to make the same mistakes.

## Supervised 3: Classification (Multiple Class)
untuk dataset yang digunakan pada supervised bagian 3 yakni terkait fifa_dataset:
https://github.com/rashida048/Datasets/blob/master/fifa.csv

### Penjelasan Singkat Supervised 3
- Multiclass algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to classify data into more than two classes. This is in contrast to binary classification algorithms, which can only classify data into two classes.
